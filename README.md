# Application Fuzzer

Learning about buffer overflows so writing my own fuzzer. Idea is to generate
unique random bytes to throw at an application to see if it crashes. If so
input exception offset and develop exploit from crash info.

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

Pip install dependencies 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

This has been done a million times in much cleaner and better code, but doing is learning and
the first step to being kind of good at something is to be terrible at something.
